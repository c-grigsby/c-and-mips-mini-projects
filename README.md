# C and MIPS Mini Projects

A collection of short projects to provide an introduction to programming with C and MIPS assembly language

---

## Project Description

- interprocess-communication
- file handling
- command-line argument passing
- arrays
- compound conditional statements
- MIPS assembly language conversions
- string manipulation
- bubble sort
- function calls and stack handling in MIPS

## Getting Started

1. To Create the Binary

```
$ gcc [options] <sourceFile> -o <binaryName>
```

2. To Run

```
$ ./<binaryName>
```

### Options

-ansi: Affects the particular version of the the C-language to use (see ANSI C, a.k.a. C89).

-pedantic: Tells the compiler to give its most clear and explicit error and warning messages.

-Wall: Tells the compiler to display all warnings, even those considered relatively minor and unimportant.

-Werror: Tells the compiler to treat warnings as errors and NOT generate and executable when any warnings occur.

-lm: Causes the compiler to link a library that provides certain Standard Library functions.
